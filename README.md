In ths application two people can play the game known as mancala where the objective is to collect as many stones as possible in the end slot that is located opposite to the player.
The player who collects the most stones wins.
In this application the players can select from one of the two provided styles for the look and feel of the game. They can also choose how many stones each slot will have at the start of the game.
Each player has access to one row of slots.
